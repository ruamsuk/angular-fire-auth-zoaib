## Project Overview

This project is based on the lessons from Zoaib on UDEMY. The lessons were taught using Angular v.16 and Angular Material, but I chose to use Angular v.18 with PrimeNG PrimeFlex because of their simplicity and appealing design. The project involved some complexities, and I relied heavily on AI Copilot for assistance, along with some trial and error on my part. Now that it's completed, I'll be sending it to my instructor, Zoaib, for feedback and suggestions for further improvement.
